            <p>Catch the Gel is a team project, where I shared the responsibilities of the user research, user experience, and interaction design. Our main goal was to provide assistance to Roskilde Festival with a sanitation solution based on the concept of

            <p>
              Catch the Gel was a project developed for the course Design for Interaction at DTU. The task required by the professor was to design a gamified solution that corrected any kind of human behavior. The team came up with the idea of choosing Roskilde
              Festival as our setting with the hope that they would allow us to deploy it there and earn free tickets to the festival.

          <h3>Discovering The Issues</h3>
          <div class="content-text-block">
            <p>Once the task and the setting were defined, the team made a study of all the problems we could solve at Roskilde Festival. 4/6ths of the team had attended the festival several times and had a very good idea of what issues were present. The
              following three came up as the more critical ones:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Trash</li>
              <li>Sanitation</li>
              <li>Dehydration</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <h3 class="section-subtitle">Defining A Topic</h3>
          <div class="content-text-block">
            <p>The team decided to use the double diamond methodology to take on this project. Starting with the discovery phase were a brainstorm session was conducted that opened up the possibilities. Then we defined and discarded the more unfeasible ideas.
              After thorough consideration, a decision was made on preventing attendees from getting sick by tackling the sanitation problem.

        <div class="content-text-block">
          <p>
            Once the problem was defined, the team moved into the development phase and the first task was to understand how the festival attendees were getting sick from the lack of sanitation. To figure this out we decided to map out a typical festival
            experience and point out the risk areas.

        <div class="content-text-block">
          <p>
            The decision to focus on a sanitation solution before eating rather than after going to the toilet came from the problem setup itself. By previously deciding on preventing sickness it was easier to decide where to implement the solution. The reason
            that attendees get sick is the ingestion of bacteria while eating, coming from dirty hands.

        <div class="content-text-block">
          <p>
            Once the decision was made to target the hands of the participants right before they were going to eat. The team started to brainstorm again now in the shape of paper sketches for possible solutions. The winning concept consisted of a game that
            encouraged the user to move their hands fast enough to catch the (sanitizing) gel. Afterward, it displayed how fast or slow they had been.

          <p>To test the whole system, including how efficient the system will be against traditional non-gamified solutions we conducted the following experiment. We placed a video camera during lunchtime in front of a Street Food Car at DTU that had a
            regular sanitizing gel dispenser solution and counted the number of people that used the regular solution.
